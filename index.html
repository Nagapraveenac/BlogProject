                    <p><em><b>India</b> is a place where one can explore huge varieties in food.
                    Indian food is know for its diversity. Diversity in cooking, flavours, ingredients
                    which ultimately represents<u> Indian tradition and culture.</u></em>

                    /food-and-cuisine.html"> Known for its diversity that varies with every region, state, community,
                     culture and even religion, food in India is a vibrant assortment of uncountable dishes. 
                     It is distinctly characterised by the subtle and sophisticated use of spices, grains, fruits and vegetables 
                     that are all grown in the country. Home to people of many religions who come from a plethora of cultural 
                     backgrounds, the food culture of the country has been influenced by all of them, including foreigners.
